			<Text>Blessings be upon you, Wonggu Mununggurr of the Djapu clan. As an elder of the Yolngu, you played an integral part in the history of your people after their contact with Europeans. When the Caldon Bay crisis proposed punitive expedition against your people, you formed a friendly relationship with Donald Thomson, de-escalating the crisis and turning hostile interactions into prosperous ones. The Yolngu, of course, are no stranger to peaceful trade with faraway people having long sent trepangs to the Macassans and China beyond. Much like the traders of the past, you navigated a world of changing allegiances, punitive expeditions, and people who would do you ill.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Wise Wonggu, you must once again fight for your people. Much have changed, but much is still yet to be done to establish strong relations of prosperity. Can you navigate a treacherous world of intrigue and trade? Will you build a civilization that can stand the test of time?</Text>

			<Text>The lippa-lippa were dugout canoes used by the Yolngu people of Arnhem Land. These types of canoes were constructed much more easily than the traditional bark canoes, requiring less time and effort. These types of canoes were first used in roughly 1640 by the Yolngu, as they were brought by Buginese farmers of sea cucumbers from South Sulawesi, known as trepangers. The wood used in the construction of lippa-lippa were essential to their strength and durability. In most cases, a native sycamore wood was used, carving the exterior of the tree to be even and then hollowing out the inner wood to create a useable craft. These canoes greatly increased the ability of the tribal hunters to catch and kill sea turtles and dugongs, essential components of the diet. Lippa-lippa offered a far greater range of travel compared to traditional canoes which allowed for trade outside the area of the village. The lippa-lippa were capable of traveling distances over 500 km.</Text>

The complete system of Yolngu customary law is known as Ngarra, or as the Madayan. Madayan embodies the rights of the owners of the law, or citizens who have the rights and responsibilities for this embodiment of law. Galarrwuy Yunupingu has described Rom watangu as the overarching law of the land, which is "lasting and alive... my backbone". This law covers the ownership of land and waters, the resources on or within these lands and waters. It regulates and controls production and trade and the moral, social and religious law including laws for the conservation and the farming of plants and aquatic life.</Text>

			<Text>The Yolngu engaged in extensive trade annually with Macassan fishermen at least two centuries before contact with Europeans. They made yearly visits to harvest trepang and pearls, paying Yolngu in kind with goods such as knives, metal, canoes, tobacco and pipes. In 1906, the South Australian Government did not renew the Macassans' permit to harvest trepang, and the disruption caused economic losses for the regional Yolngu economy. Yolngu also had well-established trade routes within Australia, extending to Central Australian clans and other Aboriginal countries. They did not manufacture boomerangs themselves but obtained these via trade from Central Australia.</Text>

			<Text>The Yolngu had known about Europeans before the arrival of British in Australia through their contact with Macassan traders, which probably began around the sixteenth century. Their word for European, Balanda, is derived from the Makassar language via the Malay "orang belanda". In 1883, the explorer David Lindsay was the first colonial white to penetrate Yolngu lands for the purposes of making a survey of its resources and prospects. He trekked along the Goyder River to reach the Arafura Swamp on the western fringe of Wagilak land. What followed was a period of hostile property owners, such as the case with Florida Station.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the early 20th century, punitive expeditions were launched into the territories of the Yolngu. From 1903 to 1908, the property rights of much of Arnhem Land were held by the Eastern and African Cold Storage Supply Company. This Anglo-Australian consortium leased the region under the name of Arafura cattle station and attempted to construct a massive cattle raising and meat production industry. The company employed roving gangs of armed men to shoot the resident Aboriginal population. In 1932 five Japanese trepangers were speared by Yolŋu men, in what became known as the Caledon Bay crisis. Yolngu men testified that their actions arose in response to the abuse of their women and to thrashings and firing on them by the Japanese crew. The Aboriginal evidence was ignored in the trials which led to their conviction and the imprisonment of five Yolngu in Fannie Bay Gaol in present-day Darwin. Only the intervention of missionaries, who had a foothold on the fringes of this area, and of the anthropologist Donald Thomson averted an official reprisal.</Text>

			<Text>Contemporarily, Yolngu artists are among the most well recognised Aboriginal artists in Australia. Yothu Yindi, a band with Aboriginal and balanda (non-Aboriginal) members, formed in 1986, and lead singer Mandawuy Yunupingu, are some of the most widely recognised performers. That tradition has continued, with artist Baker Boy, Young Australian of the year in 2019, continuing the rich musical history. Before the emergence of the Western Desert art movement, the most well-known Aboriginal art was the Yolngu style of fine cross-hatching paintings on bark.</Text>

			<Text>From 1932 to 1934, five Japanese trepang fishers were killed by Aboriginal Australians of the Yolngu people. A police officer investigating the deaths, Albert McColl, was subsequently killed. Shortly afterwards, two white men went missing on Woodah Island. This led to the proposal of a punitive by Northern Territory Police to "teach the blacks a lesson". However, it was feared that a punitive expedition would lead to an event similar to the 1928 Coniston massacre, and thus, three of Wonggu’s sons were charged with murder and persuaded to return to Darwin for trial in 1934. Eventually after extensive lobbying they were released in 1936.</Text>

Thomson had been sent to the Northern Territory of Arnhem Land to investigate and hopefully deescalate the situation and stop the spread of similar causes throughout Australia. The friendship was sparked after Mununggurr's children were arrested and gave Thompson a mak, or message stick, to give to their father. As a sign of respect, Wonggu gave Thomson bark paintings in return. During their accounts of the Caledon Bay Crisis, Ion Idriess and Victor Hall characterized Wonggu as an evil genius. Thomson instead respected him as a ‘gallant warrior', 'frank and completely fearless'. He described Wonggu as 'a tall, powerful man with [an] intelligent face, deep set eyes and a heavy beard, trimmed almost in Van Dyck style'. </Text>

			<Text>After the accusations of murder against his children, in response, Wonggu decided to move him family away from Caldeon Bay to Yirrkala. In 1936 a Methodist Overseas Mission was established in Yirrkala, with the goals of spreading Christianity as well as helping to support the Yirrkala community. As the mission gained ground it sought funding from artwork made by local people, Wonggu Mununggurr included. In 1947 Wonggu Mununggurr alongside many other leaders of the Yirrkala community did a series of paintings. These paintings were originally done in natural pigments on bark amounting to over 200 pieces. Anthropologists Catherine and Ronald Berndt commissioned those works for research and record of indigenous art. Soon thereafter these 200 works were produced the Berndt's recommissioned the art to be done on mediums of crayon and paper so that it could be transported without fear of destruction. Now many of Wonggu Mununggurr's crayon works are held in the Berndt Museum of Anthropology of the University of Western Australia, Perth.</Text>

In 1943, as the war moved northward from the Australian coast, the NTSRU was disbanded. Wonggu died on 7 June 1959 at Yirrkala.</Text>
