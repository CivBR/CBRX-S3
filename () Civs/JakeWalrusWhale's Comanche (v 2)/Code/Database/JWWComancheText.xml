You terrorised the colonial invaders of both Mexico and the United States, leading many raids and defences of your territory. But your fortune could not last, and in response to your raid, colonial authorities organised the Antelope Hills Expedition, culminating in the called Battle of Little Robe Creek, where your armour could no longer protect you.

			<Text>The Comanche are a Native-American nation from the Great Plains whose historic territory consisted of most of present-day northwestern Texas and adjacent areas in eastern New Mexico, southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, and western Oklahoma in the United States, and northern Chihuahua in Mexico. The Comanche language is a Numic language of the Uto-Aztecan family. It was originally a Shoshoni dialect, but has diverged over time to become a separate language. The Comanche became the dominant tribe on the southern Great Plains in the 18th and 19th centuries. They are often characterized as "Lords of the Plains" and they presided over a large area called Comancheria, which came to include large portions of present-day Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas. Comanche power depended on bison, horses, trading, and raiding. The Comanche hunted the bison of the Great Plains for food and skins; their adoption of the horse from Spanish colonists in New Mexico made them more mobile; they traded with the Spanish, French, Americans and neighboring Native-American peoples; and, most famously they waged war on and raided European settlements as well as other Native Americans.</Text>

			<Text>The Proto-Comanche movement to the Plains was part of the larger phenomenon known as the “Shoshonean Expansion” in which that language family spread across the Great Basin and across the mountains into Wyoming. The Kotsoteka were probably among the first. Other groups followed. Contact with the Shoshones of Wyoming was maintained until the 1830s when it was broken by the advancing Cheyennes and Arapahoes. After the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, various Plains peoples acquired horses, but it was probably some time before they were very numerous. As late as 1725, Comanches were described as using large dogs rather than horses to carry their bison hide "campaign tents." The horse became a key element in the emergence of a distinctive Comanche culture. It was of such strategic importance that some scholars suggested that the Comanche broke away from the Shoshone and moved southward to search for additional sources of horses among the settlers of New Spain to the south.</Text>

			<Text>If a woman went into labor while the band was in camp, she was moved to a tipi, or a brush lodge if it was summer. One or more of the older women assisted as midwives. Men were not allowed inside the tipi during or immediately after the delivery. Sometimes a man named his child, but mostly the father asked a medicine man to do so. He did this in the hope of his child living a long and productive life. During the public naming ceremony, the medicine man lit his pipe and offered smoke to the heavens, earth, and each of the four directions. He prayed that the child would remain happy and healthy. He then lifted the child to symbolize its growing up and announced the child's name four times. He held the child a little higher each time he said the name. It was believed that the child's name foretold its future. The Comanche looked on their children as their most precious gift. Children were rarely punished, and if they were, an older sister or other relative was called upon to discipline a child, or the parents arranged for a boogey man to scare the child.</Text>

After entombment, the rider covered the body with stones and returned to camp, where the mourners burned all the deceased's possessions. The primary mourner slashed their arms to express his grief. The Quahada band followed this custom longer than other bands and buried their relatives in the Wichita Mountains.</Text>

			<Text>Men wore a leather belt with a breechcloth, a long piece of buckskin that was brought up between the legs and looped over and under the belt at the front and back, and loose-fitting deerskin leggings. Moccasins had soles made from thick, tough buffalo hide with soft deerskin uppers. The Comanche men wore nothing on the upper body except in the winter, when they wore warm, heavy robes made from buffalo hides with knee-length buffalo-hide boots. Young boys usually went without clothes except in cold weather. In the 19th century, men used woven cloth to replace the buckskin breechcloths, and the men began wearing loose-fitting buckskin shirts. The women decorated their shirts, leggings and moccasins with fringes made of deerskin, animal fur, and human hair. They also decorated their shirts and leggings with patterns and shapes formed with beads and scraps of material. Comanche women wore long deerskin dresses. The dresses had a flared skirt and wide, long sleeves, and were trimmed with buckskin fringes along the sleeves and hem.</Text>

			<Text>The language spoken by the Comanche people, Comanche, is a Numic language of the Uto-Aztecan language group. It is closely related to the language of the Shoshone, from which the Comanche diverged around 1700. The two languages remain closely related, but a few low-level sound changes inhibit mutual intelligibility. The earliest records of Comanche from 1786 clearly show a dialect of Shoshone, but by the beginning of the 20th century, these sound changes had modified the way Comanche sounded in subtle, but profound, ways. Although efforts are now being made to ensure survival of the language, most of its speakers are elderly, and less than one percent of the Comanches can speak it.  Comanches were among the Native Americans who were first utilized as Code Talkers by the U.S. Army during World War I.</Text>

			<Text>The earliest references to them in the Spanish records date from 1706, when reports reached Santa Fe that Utes and Comanches were about to attack. In the Comanche advance, the Apaches were driven off the Plains. By the end of the eighteenth century the struggle between Comanches and Apaches had assumed legendary proportions: in 1784, in recounting the history of the southern Plains, Texas governor Domingo Cabello recorded that some sixty years earlier the Apaches had been routed from the southern Plains in a nine-day battle at La Gran Sierra del Fierro. There is, however, no other record, documentary or legendary, of such a fight.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_JWW_COMANCHE_TEXT_8">
			<Text>They were formidable opponents who developed strategies for using traditional weapons for fighting on horseback. Warfare was a major part of Comanche life. Comanche raids into Mexico traditionally took place during the full moon, when the Comanche could see to ride at night. This led to the term "Comanche Moon", during which the Comanche raided for horses, captives, and weapons. This was part of the wider Comanche Wars, where the Comanche fought a number of conflicts against Spanish and later Mexican and American armies. These were both expeditionary, as with the raids into Mexico, and defensive in nature. The Comanche were noted for being fierce warriors who fought vigorously to defend their homeland of Comancheria. However, the massive population of the settlers from the east and the diseases they brought with them led to mounting pressure and subsequent decline of the Comanche power and the cessation of their major presence in the southern Great Plains. This was contrasted with the fact that the Comanche were valued as trading partners since 1786 via the Comancheros of New Mexico. At one point, Sam Houston, president of the newly created Republic of Texas, almost succeeded in reaching a peace treaty with the Comanche in the 1844 Treaty of Tehuacana Creek. His efforts were thwarted in 1845 when the Texas legislature refused to create an official boundary between Texas and the Comancheria. While the Comanche managed to maintain their independence and increase their territory, by the mid-19th century, they faced annihilation because of a wave of epidemics due to Eurasian diseases to which they had no immunity, such as smallpox and measles.</Text>

			<Text>The US began efforts in the late 1860s to move the Comanche into reservations, with the Treaty of Medicine Lodge in 1867, which offered churches, schools, and annuities in return for a vast tract of land totalling over 60,000 square miles. The government then promised to stop the buffalo hunters, who were decimating the great herds of the Plains, provided that the Comanche, along with the Apaches, Kiowas, Cheyenne, and Arapahos, move to a reservation totalling less than 5,000 square miles of land. However, the government reneged, and did not prevent the slaughtering of the herds. Therefore, the Comanche under Quenatosavit White Eagle, retaliated by attacking a group of hunters in the Texas Panhandle in the Second Battle of Adobe Walls (1874). The attack was a disaster for the Comanche, and the US army was called in during the Red River War to drive the remaining Comanche in the area into the reservation, culminating in the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon. Within just 10 years, the buffalo were on the verge of extinction, effectively ending the Comanche way of life as hunters. In May 1875, the last free band of Comanches, led by the Quahada warrior Quanah Parker, surrendered and moved to the Fort Sill reservation in Oklahoma. The last independent Kiowa and Kiowa Apache had also surrendered.</Text>

New allotments were made in 1906 to all children born after the agreement, and the remaining land was opened to white settlement. With this new arrangement, the era of the Comanche reservation came to an abrupt end.</Text>

			<Text>Entering the Western economy was a challenge for the Comanche in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many tribal members were defrauded of whatever remained of their land and possessions. Appointed paramount chief by the United States government, Chief Quanah Parker campaigned vigorously for better deals for his people, meeting with Washington politicians frequently; and helped manage land for the tribe. Parker became wealthy as a cattleman. He also campaigned for the Comanches' permission to practice the Native American Church religious rites, such as the usage of peyote, which was condemned by European Americans. During World War II, many Comanche left the traditional tribal lands in Oklahoma to seek jobs and more opportunities in the cities of California and the Southwest. About half of the Comanche population still lives in Oklahoma, centered on the town of Lawton.</Text>

Known in their native tongue as Penateka, among other names, this band was known also as the Southern Comanche, who were the southernmost, largest, and best known band among white settlers. This was as they lived near the first Spanish and Texan settlements. Their tribal areas extended from the upper reaches of the rivers in central Texas and Colorado River southward, including much of the Edwards Plateau, and eastward to the Western Cross Timbers. It was this band that was were settled on a reservation in what was then called Indian Territory, now Oklahoma. Comanche raids were frequent, and notable raids include the Fort Parker Massacre, the Battle of Long Creek and the Battle of Plum Creek, among others. These conflicts became known as the Comanche Wars in the United States.</Text>

			<Text>Iron Jacket, born Puhihwitsikwasu, was a Comanche chieftain and medicine man whom the Comanche believed had the power to blow bullets aside with his breath. His name probably resulted from his habit of wearing a Spanish coat of mail into battle, which protected him from most light weapons fire. Not much is known about Iron Jacket's early life. He was born in the late 1780s or early 1790s, likely being son or nephew to Kwahadi chief Waakakwasi, who was likely also known as Iron Jacket for the same reason. It is believed today that he was a hereditary chief of the Comanche, and for decades the US and Mexican victims of his raids considered him a supernatural being because of his seeming invulnerability to any harm. Members of the Rangers, posses and the military on various occasions insisted that they shot the chief dead center without harming him. Little else is known about Iron Jacket, except that he led dozens of raids on settlers from the 1820s to the 1850s in Texas and Mexico. Iron Jacket's son was the famous Comanche War Chief Peta Nocona and his grandson was the last Comanche Chief Quanah Parker.</Text>

			<Text>The years leading up to the Civil War were particularly bloody on the Texas Frontier, as Iron Jacket, his son Peta Nocona, and other Comanche and Kiowa Chiefs fought back against the encroaching white settlers in the Comancheria. In response to these raids, on January 27, 1858, Governor Runnels appointed John Salmon "Rip" Ford, a veteran Ranger of the Mexican–American War and frontier Indian fighter, as captain and commander of the Texas Ranger, Militia, and Allied Indian Forces, and ordered him to carry the battle to the Comanches in the heart of their homeland on the Comancheria. On March 19, 1858, Ford went to the Brazos Reservation, near what today is the city of Fort Worth, Texas, and recruited the Tonkawa into his forces. Tonkawa Indians, the latter commanded by their chief, Placido, hailed as the "faithful and implicitly trusted friend of the whites", undertook a campaign with approximately an equal number of Texas Rangers against the Comanches. Ford and Placido were determined to follow the Comanche and Kiowa up to their strongholds amid the hills of the Canadian River, and into the Wichita Mountains, and if possible, "kill their warriors, decimate their food supply, strike at their homes and families and generally destroy their ability to make war".</Text>

Ford, still operating under Governor Runnell's explicits orders to "follow any and all trails of hostile and suspected hostile Indians, inflict the most severe and summary punishment", and to "allow no interference from any source". That source was interpreted to mean the United States, whose Army and Indian Agents might try to enforce federal treaties and federal statutory law against trespassing on the Indian territories in Oklahoma. On April 15, Ford's Rangers, accompanied by Tonkawa warriors, and Anadarko and Shawnee scouts from the Brazos Indian Reservation in Texas, crossed the Red River into Indian Territory. The force then advanced into the portion of the Comancheria in the Indian Territories in Oklahoma. Ford led his men across the Red River, into the Indian Territory, violating federal laws and numerous treaties, but stating later that his job was to "find and fight Indians, not to learn geography".</Text>

			<Text>At sunrise on May 12, 1858, Ford and his joint force of Rangers and Tonkawa began an all-day battle with a dawn attack on a sleeping Comanche village. The so-called Battle of Little Robe Creek was actually three distinct separate incidents which happened over the course of a single day. The first was the attack on the sleeping village. The second was a follow-up attack on the village of Iron Jacket, somewhat further up the Canadian River. Iron Jacket was killed in this exchange, and the remainder of his village was saved by the timely intervention of Peta Nocona with a third force of Comanche who arrived to engage Ford while all the villages along the Canadian made a swift withdrawal. Iron Jacket's death came when he repeatedly rode down the line of firing Rangers and Tonkawa, taunting them. Many historians believe the mail that protected him from light weapons fire simply was not able to protect him from the buffalo gun used by Tonkawa Jim Pockmark which killed him or, as Ford records, "six rifle shots rang on the air". In any event, the death of their legendary chief discouraged his warriors, and only the timely intervention of his son, Peta Nocona, and his warriors saved Iron Jacket's village. As it was, his body could not be recovered, and he was scalped and partially eaten by the cannibal Tonkawas. The Rangers broke up his coat of mail and kept the shingles for souvenirs. His other accoutrements, such as his lance and shield, were sent to the Governor in Austin for display.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_BUILDINGS_JWW_HALF_MOON_CHURCH_TEXT">
			<Text>The Half-Moon style of the peyote ceremony was a ceremony of the Peyote religion, also known as the Native American Church. The Peyote religion was one started by Comanche leader Quanah Parker, who was a proponent of the half-moon style. He taught that the sacred peyote medicine was the sacrament given to the Indian peoples and was to be used with water when taking communion in a traditional Native American Church medicine ceremony. He is said to have adopted the Peyote religion after having been gored in southern Texas by a bull. The Half-Moon fireplace, which is a ceremonial peyote altar, uses a half-moon shaped sand altar, with the colour of sand and size used varying between tribes, uses tobacco and corn-shucks during main sections of the service, has the prayer staff passed around the tipi during singing sections, and four main ceremonial songs are sung. This is in contrast with the Cross style of Peyote ceremony. The peyote ties into a prominent belief of the Native American Church, which is that all plants are purposefully created by the Great Spirit. Disease and death are believed to be a result of an imbalance in the individual. Besides peyote, other sacred plants, prayer, and fasting are used to cure this imbalance.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_RELIGION_JWW_PEYOTISM_PEDIA">
			<Text>The Native American Church, also known as Peyotism and Peyote Religion, is a Native American religion that teaches a combination of traditional Native American beliefs and Christianity, with sacramental use of the entheogen peyote. The religion originated in the Oklahoma Territory in the late nineteenth century, after peyote was introduced to the southern Great Plains from Mexico. The plant is believed to have been created by the Great Spirit, and is used for spiritual and healing purposes. Today it is the most widespread indigenous religion among Native Americans in the United States, Canada and Mexico, with an estimated 250,000 adherents. While some dislike the inclusion of Christian beliefs vecause of Christianity's relation to colonialism, others belive in the importance of forgiveness and seek to restore the relationship between the Church and Christians. </Text>
