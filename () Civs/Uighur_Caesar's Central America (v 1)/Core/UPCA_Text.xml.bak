			<Text>The Federal Republic of Central America, also called the United Provinces of Central America in its first year of creation, was a confederation that consisted of the territories of the former Captaincy General of Guatemala of New Spain. It existed from 1823 to 1841, as a republican democracy. The republic consisted of the present-day Central American countries of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the southern Mexican state of Chiapas. In the 1830s, a sixth state, Los Altos, was added, occupying parts of what are now the western highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As in most Ibero-American countries, the independence of Central America was essentially a Creole movement and did not imply an immediate improvement in the living conditions for Central American peasants. It was promoted by the commercial elite of Guatemala and El Salvador to enrich themselves with the new commercial ties that they hoped to acquire with England, France, Holland, the Russian Empire and the United States, and not so much by a wider social or political revolution. The new Republic had major projects, such as an interoceanic navigation channel between the Atlantic and the Pacific. However, at the same time, the federation faced great problems and opposition from conservatives (especially Clan Aycinena - a commercial and political dynasty in Guatemala), the Spanish representatives of the Catholic Church, and the large landowners of the regional aristocracies. In addition, the federal state lacked funds for its ambitious developments and faced intervention from foreign nations, such as Great Britain and the United States.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1825, the liberal-dominated Assembly elected Manuel José Arce as president but he soon turned against his own faction and dissolved the Assembly, seeking to move Central America towards a unitarian system rather than federalism. San Salvador rose in revolt against Arce and was soon followed by Honduras and Nicaragua. Arce was deposed in 1829 after Francisco Morazan, an Honduran liberal, lead the federalists to victor in the Central American civil war. Morazán was proclaimed president in 1830 and would govern for most of the decade, consolidating power for the liberal side. In this way, the new president and his allies placed themselves in a superior position to implement reforms based on the Enlightenment. Following these principles, they would try to dismantle what they considered archaic institutions inherited from the colonial era that had only contributed to the backwardness of the region. Among these policies were free trade, inviting foreign capital and immigrants, separating the Church from the State, proclaiming freedom of religion and expression, confiscating ecclesiastical property, suppressing religious orders, abolishing tithes, and removing the church's control over education.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The dissolution of the Federal Republic of Central America began with the fall of the liberal government of Dr. Mariano Gálvez in the State of Guatemala in 1837. A cholera epidemic in Guatemala lead to mistrust of the liberal government, especially by the indigenous and mestizo population, who would find a leader in the conservative general Rafael Carrera. Carrera, despite being illiterate, was very charismatic and popular, so much so that he was even referred to as "King of the Indians." Civil war would break in 1838, with Nicaragua being the first state to secede, followed by Honduras and Costa Rica. Ultimately, Carrera's conservative army would defeat Morazan and the Central American liberals in 1840, resulting in the disintegration of the federation.</Text>

			<Text>Laicism, the separation of the Catholic Church from public institutions, was a principal goal of the Central American liberalism in the 19th century. This was particularly applied towards education which had previously been the domain of the Church and religious orders such as the Jesuits. During his presidency, Francisco Morazan ordered the confiscation of ecclesiastical properties, many of which were repurposed as public schools to achieve secular, universal education. This practice would be repeated by other Central American leaders during the latter half of the century, such as Justo Rufino Barrios in Guatemala and Marco Aurelio Soto in Honduras.</Text>

			<Text>The Ejercito Aliado Protector de la Ley was an army created by Francisco Morazan during the Central American civil war in October of 1827. Composed primarily of Hondurans, Salvadorans, and Nicaraguans, the Ejercito fought for the liberal, federalist side against the conservative government of Manuel José de Arce y Fagoaga, who had sought a unitarian, centralist state. Morazan would led the Ejercito Aliado Protector to victory at the Battle of La Trinidad in Honduras, propelling him to fame and establishing him as the leader of the liberal faction. However, this success would eventually come to end in the late 1830s when Morazan and his Ejercito where vanquished by Rafael Carrera and his rebellious troops, bringing an end to the period of Central American unity. A final attempt to restore the federal republic was tried by Morazan in 1842 when he assumed power in Costa Rica, ultimately ending in a swift defeat and resulting in his arrest and exectution by firing squad. The Ejercito Aliado Protector would have an enduring legacy after Morazan's death as several of its officers become political leaders throughout Central America, particularly in Honduras where multiple presidents were veterans of the Ejercito including José Trinidad Cabañas, José Santos Guardiola, and Francisco Ferrera.</Text>

			<Text>Francisco Morazán was a Central American politician who was president of the Federal Republic of Central America from 1830 to 1839. Before he was president of Central America he was the head of state of Honduras. He rose to prominence at the battle of La Trinidad on November 11, 1827. Morazán then dominated the political and military scene of Central America until his execution in 1842.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the political arena, Francisco Morazán was recognized as a visionary and great thinker, as he attempted to transform Central America into one large and progressive nation. He enacted liberal reforms in the new Federal Republic of Central America, including freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Morazán also limited church power by making marriage secular and abolishing government-aided tithing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These reforms made him some powerful enemies, and his period of rule was marked by bitter infighting between liberals and conservatives. But through his military skills, Morazán was able to keep a firm grip on power until 1837, when the Federal Republic became irrevocably fractured. This was exploited by the conservative leaders, who rallied around the leadership of Rafael Carrera and in order to protect their own interests, ended up dividing Central America into five nations.</Text>

			<Text>May your fight for liberty always be a triumphant one, great leader Francisco Morazan. Amid the turmoil of the Central American Civil War, you arose from a humble local position in Tegucigalpa to become the liberal side's greatest general. Claiming victory first at La Trinidad and then throughout the fledling nation, your forces would prevail and pave the way through your election. In your decade as the dominant leader the Federal Republic, you instituted countless reforms aimed at developing a secular national education and developing the potential of Central America. Ultimately, the federation would not last as in the earlier 1840s, Central America would become engulfed in another civil war, this time bringing its demise. However, the enlightenment influenced reforms of your government and your bravery as a warrior for independence would forever remain influnetial throughout the history of Central America.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]President Morazan, once again your people entrust you with their destiny. Can you ensure national unity and prevent insidious factionalism? Can you reshape the society of Central America into one of enlightenment? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?</Text>
